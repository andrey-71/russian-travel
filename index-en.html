            According to VCIOM polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere,
            but only 36% plan to spend their holidays in their home country.
            Like, what have we not seen here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole
            universe with the gentle sea of ​​the south, the dense forests of
            the Sayan Mountains and the harsh ice of the Putorana Plateau. And
            you can also see all these beauties without millions in your
            account, a passport and many hours of flights. Like, for example,
            Vera Bashmakova - a brave young mother who took three children in
            her arms, put them in her "Lada" and drove 20 thousand kilometers
            through her native country. We have selected and described some
            interesting places worthy of your vacation.

                Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia. Primarily
                because of the mountains: if you go along the ridge, you will
                see slopes covered with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes.
                And if you open the windows in the car, you can get acquainted
                with the invisible miracle of these places - the mountain air.
              </p>
              <p class="place__paragraph">
                The climate in Altai is moderate, so it is best to go here in
                summer. This way you will see all the variety of local flora and
                fauna. Elk roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the
                ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous Pallas'
                cat are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory.

                Everyone knows Baikal as the largest lake in the world. Many
                also know that this is the largest source of fresh water and one
                of the most beautiful places in Russia.

              <p class="place__paragraph">
                Of course, this is all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place
                for skiing competitions. This is a sport where the skier ties
                himself to the motorcycle and the tandem tries to develop as
                fast as possible on the ice. In March 2019, a world record was
                set at the Baikal Mile festival - 197.011 km / h.

                parks have never known an ax because of the impenetrable swamps.
                Some pines are more than half a millennium old. Touch a living
                creature that has seen the sun before Ivan the Terrible saw it.
                In the virgin forest for a hundred kilometers you will not find
                a trail. And on rare paths, trees a couple of meters from the
                ground are marked with bear claws. So that everyone knows who is
